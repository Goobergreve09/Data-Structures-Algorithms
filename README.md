## Description

This is a fun project found on freecodecamp.org using basic fundamental javascript. These concepts helped create a Role Playing Game to help the town defeat the monsters and eventually the Dragon. This game involves strategic decision making as well as images that resemble the choices you make.

I wanted to keep my coding skills fresh while creating a fun game for friends or anybody else who wants to give it a shot and fight the dragon.
